                      <strong>Becoming a Physicist:</strong> I have loved physics from the moment I was first tought about it. I continued to learn physics after GCSEs when I was at college.
                      I study physics at the University of Portsmouth and will gain my MPhys in 2023.
                      Even outside of university I find myself learning more and more physics everyday.
                      I love being able to explain the reason behind why things happend
                      and if I do not know the answer, I will try and do a thought experiment to find it! Just like Einstein.

                      <strong>Learning and Creating Things by Coding: </strong>Having the ability to create something powerful and unique fascinates me.
                    Being able to simulate solar systems or even bigger things totally comsumes my imagination.
                  I have been doing light coding outside of university to try and gain more skills.
                Aswell as this, I have taken every computational module that my university course offers.</div>

                      <strong>Learning Languages</strong> I begin my language learning journey in school, I felt as if my learning was directed to passing exams than to be able to communicate.
                       5 years later, I researched language learning and came across Esperanto. The ability to pick up Esperanto so easily allowed me to build connections in my brain
                       and help me learning German aswell! Both languages compliment each other so well since Esperanto contains many cognates and rules as German.
                       My goals would be to speak fluently or at least have a very good comprehension in both.
